# tgspin
they don't call me the turbine for nothin'

Hello! This is where I decided to store all the files for my spinny renders of various TG landmarks.

Complete (and slowed down versions of some gifs) can be found in /gifs. All other folders are the renders I used to put together the gifs.

Mod used to make the renders: https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/isometric-renders

Site used to make the gifs: https://ezgif.com/maker (yes, I know ffmpeg exists I'm just lazy)

If you have a request of a location, please dm me on Discord: @ComradeBlaze#9807. Thank you!
